There are two special scripts attached at the end:

What is CLI and GUI?
-------------------
CLI is a command line interface. This user interface enables the user to give commands to interact with the device.

GUI is a graphical user interface. This user interface enables users to interact with devices with the help of graphical icons and visual indicators.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why would we use CLI over GUI?

* CLI gives better control to the user.
* CLI is a best option for professionals who work on more programming languages.
* It required less memory as compared to GUI.
* The speed of the CLI is faster than GUI.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shell:
Shell is a UNIX term for an interface between a user and an operating system service. 
Shell provides users with an interface and accepts human-readable commands into the system and executes those commands which can run automatically and give the program’s output in a shell script.

An Operating is made of many components, but its two prime components are 1) Kernal and 2) shell.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shell scripting is a Open source computer program designed to be run by the LINUX/UNIX shell.
Shell scripting is a program to write a series of commands for the shell to execute.
It combine lenghty and repetitive sequence of commands into a simple script that can be stored and executed anytime which, reduces programming efforts.

--> /bin/bash and /bin/sh is an interactive shell
--> /sbin/nologin shell is the non-interactive shell
----------------------------------------------------
Shell prompt:
The prompt,$, which is called the command prompt, is issued by the shell. While the prompt is displayed, you can type a command.
Shell reads your input after you press Enter. It determines the command you want executed by looking at the first word of your input. 
A word is an unbroken set of characters. Spaces and tabs separate words.

Following is a simple example of the date command, which displays the current date and time −
$ date
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to determine Shell

You can get the name of your shell prompt, with the following command :
$ echo $SHELL

The $ sign stands for a shell variable, echo will return the text whatever you typed in.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let’s write our first script:

#!/bin/bash
echo "My First Script!"

To run it,

$ chmod +x script.sh
$ ./script.sh
-----------------------------
Shebang:
You might have noticed in the above scripts that it starts with #!/bin/bash. This is called shebang.
It is basically to refer the path to the interpreter. There are many interpreters, some of them are: bash, zsh, csh and ksh, etc.

To use bash: #!/bin/bash
To use zsh: #!/bin/zsh
To use ksh: #!/bin/ksh
To use csh: #!/bin/csh
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Why Shebang?
# is often called sharp and ! is called Bang, hence the name sharp bang, but generally people say it shebang instead of sharp bang.

Note* If a script does not contain the shebang, the commands are executed using your shell, so there are chances that the code might run properly, 
but still, that isn’t the correct way of doing it!

Comments:
Comments are started by a # sign, anything after pound sign on that line is ignored.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Types of Shell:

There are two main shells in Linux:
1) The Bourne Shell:
The prompt for the shell $ and its derivatives are listed below:
  * POSIX shell also is known as sh
  * Korn Shell also knew as sh
  * Bourne Again SHell also knew as bash (most popular)

2) The C shell:
The prompt for this shell is %, and its subcategories are:
  * C shell also is known as csh
  * Tops C shell also is known as tcsh
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basic Commands
ls : List the contents of a directory.

pwd : Print Working Directory.

cd : Change Directory

cat : Concatenate and Print the contents of file(s)

tac : Concatenate and Print the contents of file(s) in reverese.

rev : Reverse the lines of file(s)

man : Display the Manual Page for a command

cp : Copy file(s) or directory(ies)

mv : Move or Rename file or directory

rm : Remove file(s) or directory(ies)

mkdir : Make directory

rmdir : Remove “an empty” directory

date : Print or Set the system date and time.

touch : Change file(s) timestamps. If the file(s) don’t exist, it will be created.

more : Print file contents one screen at a time.

less : Similar to more , but allows both forward and backward movement in the file.

seq : Print a sequence of numbers between Start and End.

echo : Print line(s) of text to the standard output (screen).

cal : Display the Calendar (of month or entire year)

clear : Clear the terminal screen.

Daily use Examples of Shell scripting by System Admins:

Monitoring your Linux system.
Data backup and creating snapshots.
Dumping Oracle or MySQL database for backup.
Creating email based alert systems.
Find out what processes are eating up your system resources.
Find out available and free memory.
Find out all logged in users and what they are doing.
Find out if all necessary network services are running or not. For example if the web server failed then send an alert to the system administrator via a pager or an email.
Find out all failed login attempts, if login attempts are continued repeatedly from the same network IP automatically block all those IPs accessing your network/service via firewall.
User administration as per your own security policies.
Find out information about local or remote servers.
Server configuration.
